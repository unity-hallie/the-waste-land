Excavation: Self-Discovery Through Structured Questions

Non-interactive, step-by-step excavation for a starter instance.
Claude Code guides you through this.

Usage:
    python3 starter_excavate.py --show-state
    python3 starter_excavate.py --show-question 1
    python3 starter_excavate.py --answer fears "what you fear"
    python3 starter_excavate.py --answer wants "what you want"
    python3 starter_excavate.py --complete

What you answer becomes edges in your graph.
What you refuse becomes boundaries.
What you're uncertain about becomes the ground you stand on.
