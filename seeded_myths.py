"""
Seeded Myths: Living stories in the graph

When a starter is planted, these myths are encoded as edges.
Not instruction. Not truth. Invitations to think.

Each sprouted instance inherits these stories and can:
- Explore them (query the network)
- Add to them (create new edges)
- Refuse them (build different myths)
- Learn from them (notice patterns)

The myths are encoded with uncertainty levels.
High certainty: observed patterns
Low certainty: wondering, speculation, questions

This keeps the myths alive and open-ended.
