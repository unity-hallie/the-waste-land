The fool is the beginning of the adventure, the child without trauma or goal. Before they first fall and learn what the problem The World has put in front of them to solve, The Fool is without aim and without care, toppling over the cliff.

## Moves
### Blank Slate
If the fool is in your deck -- and is not in shadow -- when you begin play, place it on the table to the side. You are the fool and the fool is you. You are without worry, care, or pain. 

This is your Fools Journey Spread

### The Fool's Journey
Whenever you fail a spread, if the fool is in the fool's journey and the card higher than the highest card in the fools journey,  you may replace it with the fool.

Whenever you use the fool in a simple spread, place it at the end of the fool's journey.

If the fool ever falls into shadow, shuffle all the cards in your fools journey into your deck.

## Beliefs


When you add the Fool into your deck, pick one belief that you associate with the fool. Whenever you complete a shadow spread, you must mark the belief as false, complicate it, or add a new belief.

Examples:
The world is a good place.
People are generally trying their best.
If you don't succeed, try, try again.
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
