To play the game you have a deck of 10+ cards that represent a lot of who your character is right now and what their relationship is to the world. 

TO play the game, describe what you are doing. From time to time the result of what you're doing will be unclear and -- usually one of the [[Spreads]] below can be used to resolve it. 

Whenever you do anything that requires thinking about it, you do a spread.

MOST spreads just involve you shuffling your deck and cutting to a card and using the card to determine what happens. 

### Shadow Cards
Some of your cards are Shadow Cards and you may choose to keep track of them any way you choose. You can eitehr keep them reversed and the others pointed one direction, turn them over reverse in the deck, or just keep a note on paper.

## Base Spreads

As always in a base spread, any particular rules for specific arcana on your sheet or generally supercede.
#### Fortune's Favor
Whenever something is uncertain, unknown, out of your control, or not covered by another move, you may draw your simple fortune.

The fortune teller will first draw a card and place it in front of them.

To draw a simple fortune, shuffle and cut to a single card.
