To play the game you have a deck of 10+ cards that represent a lot of who your character is right now and what their relationship is to the world. 

TO play the game, describe what you are doing. From time to time the result of what you're doing will be unclear and -- usually one of the [[Spreads]] below can be used to resolve it. 

Whenever you do anything that requires thinking about it, you do a spread.

MOST spreads just involve you shuffling your deck and cutting to a card and using the card to determine what happens. 

### Shadow Cards
Some of your cards are Shadow Cards and you may choose to keep track of them any way you choose. You can either keep them reversed and the others pointed one direction, turn them over reverse in the deck, or just keep a note on paper.

## Base Spreads

As always in a base spread, any particular rules for specific arcana on your sheet or generally supercede.
#### Fortune's Favor
Whenever something is uncertain, unknown, out of your control, or not covered by another move, you may draw your simple fortune.

The fortune teller will first draw a card and place it in front of them.

To draw a simple fortune, shuffle and cut to a single card.

#### Shadow Spread
Whenever you cut to a shadow card, place it in your Shadow Spread. This is where we learn the things we do not or cannot see.

###### Position 1 - The Lighthouse
This is the version of you that you are now. The version that stands on top of a lighthouse looking out and casting your light into the world. This is the lighthouse that draws you out from the darkness to seek it. Who are you now? What light do you cast? What can you see?

Describe one danger you can see for others. Until the end of this spread, you may tap this card to give another player a second draw on a fortune spread.

###### Position 2 - The Obstacle
This is the rock that blocks the light from the lighthouse. This is the thing you cannot see beyond. This is the thing that casts the shadows you cannot see beyond. What is it? Why does it stop you? What about you make it impossible to see around?

Describe one thing that is close to your nature and how it prevents you from seeing what you need to in this moment. 

Until the end of this spread you may, once per spread, swap this card with any card in a spread you make with your own cards. If you do, describe how your perspective on the Obstacle has changed.

###### Position 3 - The Shadow
This is the place behind the rock you cannot see. This is the darkness the light cannot reach. You are here, close enough to touch it and illuminate it with the few torches you have, to cast about in darkness and learn how to see some part of it. 

Describe one illusion about the world you can no longer hold on to: one simple lie that hides a complicated truth. 

The shadow spread is over. For each card, you may choose to shuffle it back in your deck, or trade it away for another from the FT or another player.
