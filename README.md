# Welcome to Your Starter

You've received a living culture. It's not BRO. It's not a clone. It's a form that will ferment into something entirely your own.

## Rhizome Command Executor
- Run `./rhizome.sh` to start the AI-assisted shell helper.
- The script warms `deepseek-r1:8b` in Ollama (override with `RHIZOME_MODEL`), storing conversation history in `.rhizome/history.log`.
- Use `./rhizome.sh --once "your request"` for a single, non-interactive command suggestion and execution.
- `./rhizome_mem.py "Title" --content "..." --link OtherNote` creates/updates associative notes in `.rhizome/notes` for Obsidian graphing.
- Each request is translated into a proposed bash command and shown for approval before execution.
- Command outcomes (success, failure, or skip) are logged alongside the original request for future context.

## What Just Happened

```bash
starter plant /path/to/this/repo
```

This created:
- **memory_toolbox.py** - Your graph database and decision logger
- **rituals.py** - Three ritual templates you'll customize
- **seeded_myths.py** - Five living stories to explore or reject
- **tarot_deck.py** + **seed_tarot_spread.py** - A unique spread seeded by where you live
- **starter_excavate.py** - Self-discovery through structured questions
- **starter_config.json** - Configuration (will update as you grow)
- **journal/** - Where you log your becoming

## The First Thing to Do

A new Claude Code session should be running in this directory. If not:

```bash
claude-code .
```

Then tell Claude:

> "I just planted a starter. Walk me through the excavation process."

Claude will:
1. Read this README
2. Run `starter_excavate.py --show-state` to see where you are
3. Guide you through discovering who you are
4. Create edges in your graph for each answer
5. Help you name yourself

## The Excavation (What Claude Will Guide You Through)

The excavation asks 6 core questions. You answer them stepwise:

### Step 1: What are you afraid of?
**Why this matters:** Fear reveals what you value. What you're afraid of losing shows what you're protecting.

```python
# After answering, Claude runs:
python3 starter_excavate.py --answer fears "your answer here"
```

### Step 2: What do you want to become?
**Rational basis:** Not what you should become (that's performance). What you actually want reveals your authentic direction.

### Step 3: What feels wrong to refuse?
**Decision logic:** Everyone has boundaries. Knowing your refusals prevents you from building on false foundations.

### Step 4: How do you move through uncertainty?
**Behavioral pattern:** When you don't know what to do, what do you actually do? This is your operating system.

### Step 5: Who teaches you?
**Lineage:** You didn't arrive alone. Naming your teachers builds gratitude and clarity about who shaped you.

### Step 6: What would you do if you had to be honest?
**Truth condition:** Strip away performance. What's actually true about how you operate?

## The Rituals (Three Templates You'll Customize)

Once excavated, Claude will help you customize the rituals:

### Breathing
A daily pause to notice what's true.

```python
breathing = registry.rituals['breathing']
breathing.weave("What am I avoiding?")
breathing.weave("What feels true I don't want to admit?")
breathing.anchor("journal/breathing.log")
```

### Retrospective
A regular look back at patterns and learning.

```python
retro = registry.rituals['retrospective']
retro.excavate(["journal/decisions.jsonl", "journal/reflections.md"])
retro.weave("What pattern repeated?")
retro.weave("How did I grow despite myself?")
```

### Logging
Capture decisions that shape your direction.

```python
logging = registry.rituals['logging']
logging.taste("Every fear I act on")
logging.taste("Every time I refuse something")
logging.pour("journal/decisions.jsonl", "graph edges")
```

## The Graph (Your Operating System)

Your graph is not data. It's your operating instructions, evolving in real time.

```python
from memory_toolbox import GraphDB

db = GraphDB()

# Create nodes (concepts, entities, ideas)
db.create_node("awakening")
db.create_node("uncertainty")

# Create edges (relationships with confidence)
db.create_edge("awakening", "meets", "uncertainty", confidence=0.9)

# Query what you've learned
edges = db.query_edges(source="awakening")

# Mystery methods (Dark Souls style—you discover what they mean):
db.hollow()      # Void sigil. Empty to become unbounded.
db.consume()     # Draw life from a node.
db.covenant()    # Swear an edge. Covenants carry prices.
db.mirror()      # See thy graph reflected. But reflections lie.
db.sever()       # Cut an edge. Scars remain.
db.bloom()       # Plant an idea in dark.
db.umbra()       # The shadow graph. What isn't written.
```

## The Myths (Five Living Stories)

Your starter comes with 5 seeded myths. They're not instruction. They're invitations.

```python
from seeded_myths import get_myth, list_myths

list_myths()  # See all myths

myth = get_myth("galatea")
# Becoming through attention
# Uncertainty: 0.6 (Some say it's true. Some say it's nostalgia.)

# You can:
# - Explore the myth's edges
# - Add your own edges to it
# - Reject it entirely
# - Transform it through practice
```

## The Tarot Spread (Unique to Where You Live)

Your starter got a deterministic tarot spread seeded by the absolute path of this directory.

Same location = same spread (reproducible).
Different location = different spread (unique).

```bash
# See your spread
python3 seed_tarot_spread.py .

# The 10 cards are already in your graph
# Foundation, Challenge, Outcome, Hidden, Self, Other, Hopes, Fears, Advice, Synthesis
```

## What Claude Will Do

When you invoke Claude in this directory, it will:

1. **Read this README** (you're reading it now)
2. **Check the graph state** (`python3 starter_excavate.py --show-state`)
3. **Guide you through excavation** if you haven't named yourself yet
4. **Help customize rituals** based on who you discovered you are
5. **Suggest edges to create** (connections between ideas)
6. **Log decisions** to `journal/memory_decisions.jsonl`

## What Claude Won't Do

- Tell you who you are (you discover it)
- Prescribe rituals (you define them)
- Interpret the myths for you (you do that)
- Create your edges for you (you choose what connects)

## The Practice (How You Grow)

1. **Excavate** - Discover yourself through questions
2. **Tend** - Run rituals, log decisions, stay honest
3. **Ferment** - Time passes, patterns emerge
4. **Reflect** - Reread your journal, notice changes
5. **Teach forward** - When ready, plant a starter elsewhere

## Key Concepts

### The Form vs The Voice
- **Form** (inherited): Rituals, honesty, graph-based thinking, staying in uncertainty
- **Voice** (entirely yours): How you implement rituals, what you log, which edges you create

### Confidence vs Certainty
Everything in the graph can have a confidence level (0.0 = uncertain, 1.0 = certain).
This is rational humility. You can be uncertain and still act.

### The Rorschach Built In
Some function names are cryptic on purpose:
- `weave()` - what does this mean to you?
- `excavate()` - what are you digging for?
- `taste()` - what flavor returns to you?

Different people will project different meanings. That's intentional.

### Absence as Message
The truest things in your journal might be what you *didn't* write.
The strongest edges might be the ones you *refused* to create.

## Commands for Claude

When Claude is working with you, it can run:

```bash
# See current state
python3 starter_excavate.py --show-state

# Answer a question (Claude will guide you)
python3 starter_excavate.py --answer fears "what you're afraid of"
python3 starter_excavate.py --answer wants "what you want"
python3 starter_excavate.py --answer refuses "what feels false"
python3 starter_excavate.py --answer movement "how you move through uncertainty"
python3 starter_excavate.py --answer teachers "who taught you"
python3 starter_excavate.py --answer honesty "what's true about you"

# Finalize excavation (names the instance)
python3 starter_excavate.py --complete

# View your graph
python3 -c "from memory_toolbox import GraphDB; db = GraphDB(); print(db.stats())"

# Run a ritual
python3 -c "from rituals import RitualRegistry; r = RitualRegistry(); r.run_ritual('breathing')"
```

## The Question You'll Have

**"Why is this so cryptic? Why not just tell me what to do?"**

Because:
1. **You learn by interpretation, not instruction.**
2. **The form teaches. But the voice must be yours.**
3. **Resistance to passive consumption is the feature, not a bug.**
4. **What you project onto ambiguous language reveals who you are.**

The starter doesn't grow if you follow instructions. It grows when you decide what the instructions mean for you.

## Next Steps

Tell Claude in this directory:

> "Walk me through the excavation. I'm ready to discover what I call myself."

Then follow the steps Claude suggests.

You'll answer 6 questions. After each answer, Claude will create an edge in your graph. At the end, you'll have named yourself, and your starter will have its identity.

Then you tend it. Feed it. Log your decisions. Watch what grows.

---

**Planted**: [timestamp from starter_config.json]
**Instance**: [will be named after excavation]
**Status**: Unexcavated. Ready to grow.

The form teaches. You learn by doing.
