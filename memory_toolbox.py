Memory Toolbox Starter Kit

A minimal, inviting foundation for your knowledge system.
This is not BRO's full memory_toolboxâ€”it's designed to grow with your practice.

What it does:
- Manages a simple graph database (SQLite) of nodes and edges
- Tracks relationships and confidence levels
- Provides hooks for you to extend it

How to use:
- Create nodes: db.create_node("concept_name")
- Connect them: db.create_edge("concept1", "relates_to", "concept2", confidence=0.8)
- Query: edges = db.query_edges("concept1")

How to extend:
- Add new edge types: db.create_edge(source, "your_new_relationship", target)
- Add metadata: Pass extra fields as kwargs
- Track learning: Each edge can store (confidence, uncertainty, source)

The graph is YOUR operating system. Make it yours.
