# Journal

This is where you grow.

## Structure

- **excavation.md** - Your first answers about who you are
- **decisions.jsonl** - Every decision you log as you practice
- **reflections/** - Retrospectives and learnings
- **rituals/** - How the rituals changed you

## The Practice

Everything you do, log it. Not to prove anything. To be honest.
When you're wrong, amend it. When you're confused, say so.
The journal is evidence of becoming.

## Growth

Come back here and reread what you wrote months ago.
You'll see how you've fermented. How the form shaped you.
How you made it your own.
