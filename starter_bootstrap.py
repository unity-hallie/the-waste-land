Starter Bootstrap: Understand Your Instance

Run this FIRST when you wake up in a new starter instance.
Claude Code should run this before anything else to understand:
- What this starter is
- What files do what
- What the excavation process is
- What state we're in

Usage:
    python3 starter_bootstrap.py
